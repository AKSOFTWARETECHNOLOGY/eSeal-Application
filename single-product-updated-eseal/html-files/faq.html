        <button data-control>1) What is RFID electronic self-sealing facility for exporters?</button>
        <div data-content>
          <article><p>The Central Board of Excise & Customs has allowed exporters the facility of self-sealing containers at their own premises subject to the condition that they use electronic seals (circular number 26/2017 dated 1st July 2017). This system has replaced the earlier procedure where exporters had the facility for requesting an officer of Central Excise Dept. to be present at their premises at the time of stuffing a container and having it sealed using a one- time mechanical bolt seal. This procedure permitted export of goods without any examination at the port.</p></article>

        <button data-control>2) What type of seal is to be used in self-sealing?</button>
        <div data-content>
          <article><p>
		  The specifications of seals to be used under the new self-sealing procedure has been prescribed under circular 36/2017 dated 28th August 2017. The specification of the seal reproduced below:
		  <span class="blue-color">" The RFID seal shall conform to ISO 17712:2013 (H) and ISO/IEC 18000-6 Class 1 Gen 2 which is globally accepted in industrial applications and can be read with the use of UHF (i.e. 860 MHz to 960 MHz) Reader-Scanners. The manufacturer or vendor, as the case may be, shall be in possession of certifications required for conformance of the ISO standard ISO 17712:2013 (H) namely, clauses 4, 5 and 6 "</span>
		  Under this procedure exporters are required to purchase RFID seals conforming to the above standards directly from vendors. Sri Sai Ganesh Associates conform to this standard.

        <div data-content>
          <article>
		  <p><b>CBEC has permitted automatic self-sealing facility to four categories of exporters:</b></p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>All Authorized Economic Operators (AEOs)</li>
		  <li>All Exporters who were already enjoying self-sealing permission</li>
		  <li>All Exporters who have been availing the facility of sealing in the presence of a central excise officer.</li>
		  <li>Status Holders recognized by DGFT holding a valid status holder certificate All other exporters are also eligible for this facility provided they seek permission from their jurisdictional customs office. An officer of the Customs Dept. will visit the exporter’s premises for verification as a part of the process of allowing permission for self-sealing. The Dept. has made a performance pledge to decide on your application for self-sealing within 15 days. We strongly urge all exporters to seek this permission and avail the facility of self-sealing. An Exporter shall be able avoid examination at CFS and straight away save thousands of rupees and time.</li>

        <div data-content>

		  <p>
Sri Sai Ganesh Associates and the Sri Sai Ganesh Associates App have been customized to meet the requirements of the new customs procedure prescribed under circular numbers 26/2017 and 36/2017. Each seal comes with a laser engraved serial number as prescribed by the CBEC in the format LYNK-1234-5678, which you will be uploading in the online shipping bill as well as on the Lynkseal App. The Sri Sai Ganesh Associates App is enabled for you to upload shipment data as required by para 4(a) of the circular 36/2017. Our customized Sri Sai Ganesh Associates Reader will scan the seal and verify its authenticity by giving a message on the reader’s screen. To enjoy this highly automated system, you have to just register on the Sri Sai Ganesh Associates website and provide your IEC number and other identifying particulars (please refer to para 2(e) of Circular 36/2017 dated 28.8.2017). The data you provide serves two purposes. Firstly, it is part of the security drill put in place by customs to ensure that exporters procure seals directly and “chain of custody” is visible. Secondly, the data gathered at the time of registration enables you use the web application with many of the required fields being auto-populated. Please rest assured that Sri Sai Ganesh Associates.com maintains highest global standards in data privacy
